# SMS_Scheduler
Originally a class project by Kyle Szombathy and Jonah Johnson, SMS_Scheduler (title TBD) is an android app to schedule SMS messages with a simple user interface. Development is continuing and a full release is being planned. 
Currently issues are being tracked [here](smsscheduler.myjetbrains.com). This project is open to contribution, feel free to contact me!
##Software Design Documents
Here are the documents we were required to make for the class. They include formal documents detailing the work we set out to do, including goals, plans, priorities, prototypes, diagrams, and much more. I reccommend taking a look at our final report if you want to get a quick overview of the project.
